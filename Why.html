<center>China has a thing called censorship which blocks a lot of websites, this takes Chinese citizens their freedom because they are blocking social media and thousand more websites that people use every day.
Some primary sources that could show how censorship is are like illegal blogs or websites. Some secondary sources that could show evidence are:
www.scmp.com/topics/censorship-china
https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/media-censorship-china
DNS and VPN are some solutions to bypass China censorship
All of this shows what Chinese citizens are missing what China is taking from them and my website shows why China censorship is bad because it takes freedom</center>
